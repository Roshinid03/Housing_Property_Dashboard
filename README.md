The project aims to create an ETL pipeline in AWS Cloud using services like S3 Buckets, AWS Glue, Redshift, and Power BI. The steps involve uploading and storing data in AWS Cloud, creating classifiers, databases, and a Redshift cluster, creating crawlers and connections, running SQL queries, creating visual jobs in AWS Glue, importing data into Power BI, and building a visualization dashboard.
